"""PKG downloading — adapter over the verified v2 update logic.

download_pkg() semantics (preserved exactly):
  * skips re-download when a file of the right size already exists
  * SHA-1 checked against Sony's metadata; on mismatch the file is KEPT with a
    warning message (Sony has stale hashes for some re-issued packages and
    RPCS3 verifies PKG signatures itself at install time)
  * partial files are deleted on network failure or user stop

plan_downloads() builds '<base>/PlayStation 3/[ID] Name' folders like PySN.
